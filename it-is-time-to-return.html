<h1>It Is Time To Return</h1>

<p>
to the river since we only<br />
say river when we want<br />
something else: scenic<br />
overlook or shotgun<br />
<br />
wedding. These days<br />
the language is less<br />
malleable than promised.<br />
Our mouths are traps<br />
<br />
of cotton and it's tough<br />
to talk through stitches<br />
and gauze. Would you<br />
join me if I rented that<br />
<br />
rowboat? It's delicately<br />
tethered to the last tree<br />
in sight. I've indexed<br />
the current but lost track<br />
<br />
of storms: just something else<br />
tearing through the state.<br />
Your hair looks devastating<br />
in the trade winds, meaning:<br />
<br />
let's drive to Oregon this time.<br />
I've got a backseat filled<br />
with almanacs so you can<br />
stop predicting the bends.<br />
<br />
I've heard the road lopes<br />
through hills ahead<br />
and the river always runs<br />
parallel. When my hands<br />
<br />
touch you, they're pleading:<br />
remember us like the last<br />
step toward shore, the slow<br />
space between an end<br />
<br />
and some beginning.<br />

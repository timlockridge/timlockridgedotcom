<p>
and still we wondered why the bodies<br />
of birds fell around us. It's an omen,<br />
you said, and soon dust stirred<br />
<br />
in the streets like a Western. Horses<br />
walked into the vanishing point<br />
and music swelled while the sun<br />
<br />
tucked itself into hills. A lasso<br />
appeared in my hands, and, unsure,<br />
I threw the loop through the night.<br />
<br />
The audience erupted, and, odd,<br />
you said, I hadn't noticed them before,<br />
but there they were, the bleachers<br />
<br />
bustling and full. The director declared<br />
the evening a wrap and the crew<br />
formed a caravan of Civics and unwound<br />
<br />
into Interstate. If I had known my lines<br />
were scripted, you said, I would've<br />
improvised more. Or maybe asked<br />
<br />
for something clever. At least this explains <br />
the windows, I said. Another bird kissed <br />
the ground. The stars were color bars.<br />

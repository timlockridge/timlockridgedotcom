<h1>Yesterday's Visibility</h1>

<p>
I don't know what I was thinking<br />
giving you the poem where<br />
man and woman tumbled into roses<br />
and rose scratched and scarlet<br />
at sunrise, but you were happy<br />
that their scars were only stars<br />
in a sky of skin and gone long <br />
before they reached our eyes.<br />
Later, in the novel of second chance<br />
you felt the ending was lacking—<br />
a down-note after so much<br />
exposition. I never made it past<br />
chapter three, thought little<br />
of the rising action. You followed<br />
the saga of so much potential,<br />
loved the Lifetime movie, sat<br />
on the couch and tended with tissue<br /> 
a tide cresting the levee. Elsewhere<br />
I was damned. Soon we said<br />
that words were only jamming<br />
the spaces where a flicker of touch<br />
should speak volumes, so we stood <br />
silent, let a bend of the wrist<br />
finish the story. Sunlight lit the heavy<br />
corners of your eyes, and I wanted<br />
to tell you that, to me, this was like<br />
the opening click of a waltz, <br />
but I instead touched your cheek <br />
and thought of daisies pushing <br />
upward through the snow.<br />

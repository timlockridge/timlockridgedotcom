<h1>How He Made It To Heaven</h1>

<p>
Flew on the back of a crane<br/>
to the summit where snow<br/>
knew the story of everything.<br/>
Threw a rope ladder<br/>
and reached through<br/>
the cirrocumulus<br/>
until he was on the other<br/>
half of morning and knew<br/>
he'd misunderstood sky<br/>
blue. Took the spiral staircase<br/>
but got dizzy halfway—stopped<br/>
and dropped change but never<br/>
heard the nickels hit. Wished<br/>
there was an escalator.<br/>
Saw a waterfall and swam<br/>
through the hem of its sash,<br/>
grew gills and slept.<br/>
Was touched on the shoulder<br/>
by others, invited to shore.<br/>
Asked about god.<br/>
There, they said, pointed<br/>
to a single satellite in orbit.<br/>
No, he said, God.<br/>
Then the satellite turned,<br/>
faced him and unfurled<br/>
its metal wings, the sound<br/>
of steel on steel tense<br/>
like an orchestra tuning,<br/>
then silent. He saw stained<br/>
glass, missed the mountain<br/>
below. The air stung. The sun set.<br/>

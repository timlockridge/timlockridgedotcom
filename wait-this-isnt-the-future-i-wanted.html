<h1>Wait, This Isn't The Future I Wanted</h1>

<p>
I expected more jetpacks, fewer miles<br />
between me and the moon. A navigation<br />
system so I might read magazines en route<br />
to jury duty, which is actually less than<br />
my original plan for a robotic pal to serve<br />
on the jury for me. What happened? Years<br />
unraveled and only the TV advanced.<br />
Mine hangs by a picture of Heather,<br />
the one where we scaled a small mountain<br />
and she said <em>Let's save this</em> before pulling<br />
a Polaroid from purse. The photo fell<br />
into an empty desk drawer and stayed<br />
there through several apartments. It looks<br />
ridiculous in a frame, which is to say<br />
my walls are unfinished pages. Some days<br />
I stare into them and watch the answers<br />
unfurl like morning. This is a hobby<br />
I found in childhood when a profile<br />
of Lincoln rose from a piece of wood<br />
paneling. Years of sleep and a gaudy<br />
Mount Rushmore, that's my memory<br />
of youth. Still, all that science fiction<br />
stacked against the radiator: where<br />
is my ray gun, my flying car, my machine<br />
that makes food on command? Will we<br />
ever know love in the Holodeck?<br />
I want a virtual hand in mine, an embrace<br />
of zeroes and ones. I want a Paris<br />
meant only for us, where we stroll<br />
past a still <em>Gare Du Nord</em>, the ambient rattle<br />
of tracks just a product of mood<br />
making algorithms. Does it matter<br />
that when I speak of the stars as memories,<br />
we both know they're only projections?<br />
Can I say I've imagined our sleep pod,<br />
the Mercury rains around us? I could<br />
sing of the meteor pulse<br />
while your eyes fall like light<br />
on impossible galaxies, a home<br />
just to dust and potential.<br />
